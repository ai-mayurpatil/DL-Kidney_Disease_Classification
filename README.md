# Kidney Disease Classification using MLflow & DVC
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a significant global health issue, often progressing unnoticed until it reaches an advanced stage. Early detection of CKD is crucial for timely intervention and treatment, potentially slowing disease progression and improving patient outcomes. This paper focuses on utilizing deep learning techniques to identify factors that may lead to CKD at an early stage, thereby aiding in early diagnosis.

The research utilized a publicly available dataset containing medical information collected in India. This dataset includes various attributes that are potential indicators of CKD. The initial step involved preprocessing the data to handle missing values and outliers, ensuring the dataset's integrity and suitability for analysis. Data preprocessing is a critical phase in machine learning, as it directly impacts the accuracy and reliability of the model's predictions.
